/**********************ETUDE 2 CART 360 2017*******************************
   WELCOME!
   THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO DESIGN A VERY SIMPLE KEYBOARD (5 KEYS)
   WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY LIVE, RECORD, AND PLAYBACK SINGLE NOTES (NO CHORDS).
   THERE WILL BE A BUTTON WHICH WHEN PRESSED WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE NEXT MODE:
   THERE ARE 5 POSSIBLE MODES
   0 ==  reset    ==   led off == also resets
   1 ==  live     ==   led BLUE
   2 ==  record   ==   led RED
   3 ==  play     ==   led GREEN
   4 ==  looper   ==   led PURPLE

   ADDITIONALLY - WHEN THE USER CHANGES MODE,
   THE RGB LED WILL CHANGE COLOR (ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS)

   PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE COMMENTS:
   DO NOT ADD ANY MORE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
   ONLY IMPLEMENT THE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS SUPPLIED
   THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD ANY NEW VARIABLES OR CONSTANTS
   PROVIDE COMMENTS FOR ANY OF THE CODE IMPLEMENTED
   GOOD LUCK!
*/
/**** CONSTANTS ********************************************************/

#define BUTTON_MODE_PIN 2 // Button to change the mode

// constants for RGB LED
#define LED_PIN_R 5 // R PIN
#define LED_PIN_G 9 // G PIN
#define LED_PIN_B 6 // B PIN

// constant for note in (button-resistor ladder on breadboard)
# define NOTE_IN_PIN A0

//constant for max number of notes in array
#define MAX_NOTES 16

// a constant for duration
const int duration = 200;

// constant for pin to output for buzzer
#define BUZZER_PIN 3 // PWM

/******** VARIABLES *****************************************************/
// counter for how many notes we have
int countNotes = 0;
int mode = 0; // start at off
// array to hold the notes played (for record/play mode)
int notes [MAX_NOTES];
int prevButtonState = LOW;
int prevAnalogValue = 0;
int noteAt = 0;

/*************************************************************************/


/**********************SETUP() DO NOT CHANGE*******************************/
// Declare pin mode for the single digital input
void setup()
{
  pinMode(BUTTON_MODE_PIN, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

/**********************LOOP() DO NOT CHANGE *******************************
   INSTRUCTIONS:
   There is NO NEED to change the loop - it establishes the flow of the program
   We call here 3 functions repeatedly:
   1: chooseMode(): this function will determine the mode that your program is in
   based on if the button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) was pressed
   2: setRGB(): will set the color of the RGB LED based on the value of the mode variable
   3: selectMode(): will determine which function to call based on the value of the mode variable

**************************************************************************/
void loop()
{
  chooseMode();
  setRGB();
  selectMode();
}
/******************CHOOSEMODE(): IMPLEMENT *********************************
   INSTRUCTIONS:
   Read the value from the Button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) and
   if is being pressed then change the mode variable.
   REMEMBER:
   mode == 0 is reset
   mode == 1 is live
   mode == 2 is record
   mode == 3 is play
   mode == 4 is loopMode
   Every time the user presses the button, the program will go to the next mode,
   once it reaches 4, it should go back to mode == 0.
   (i.e. if mode ==2 and we press, then mode ==3) ...
**************************************************************************/
void chooseMode() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_MODE_PIN);

  // Check if the button has been pressed
  if (buttonState != prevButtonState) {
    // If so, increase the mode.
    if (buttonState) {
      mode++;
      // If the mode is higher than 4, go back to mode 0.
      if (mode > 4) {
        mode = 0;
      }
    }

    prevButtonState = buttonState;
  }
}

/******************SETRGB(): IMPLEMENT *********************************
   INSTRUCTIONS:
   Depending on the value of the mode variable:
   if the mode is 0 - RGB LED IS OFF
   if the mode is 1 - RGB LED IS BLUE
   if mode is 2 - RGB LED IS RED
   if mode is 3 - RGB LED IS GREEN
   if mode is 4 - RGB LED iS PURPLE
   YOU MUST USE A SWITCH CASE CONSTRUCT (NOT A SERIES OF IF / ELSE STATEMENTS
**************************************************************************/
void setRGB()
{
  switch (mode) {
    case 0:
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_R, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_G, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_B, LOW);
      break;
    case 1:
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_R, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_G, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_B, HIGH);
      break;
    case 2:
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_R, HIGH);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_G, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_B, LOW);
      break;
    case 3:
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_R, LOW);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_G, HIGH);
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_B, LOW);
      break;
    case 4:
      digitalWrite(LED_PIN_R, HIGH);

/**********************SELECTMODE() DO NOT CHANGE *******************************
   INSTRUCTIONS:
   There is NO NEED to change this function - it selects WHICH function should run based on the mode variable
   There are 4 possibilities
   1: reset(): this function will reset any arrays etc, and will do nothing else
   2: live(): this function will play the corresponding notes
   to the user pressing the respective buttons.
   NOTE:: the notes played are NOT stored
   3: record(): this function will play the corresponding notes
   to the user pressing the respective buttons
   AND will STORE up to 16 consecutive notes in an array.
   4: play(): this function will playback any notes stored in the array that were recorded
   in the previous mode
   5: loopMode(): this function will playback any notes stored in the array that were recorded,
   BUT unlike the previous mode, you can choose in which sequence the notes are played.
   REQUIRED: only play notes from the array (no live stuff)

   READ each value IN ORDER
